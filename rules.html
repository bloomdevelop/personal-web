        <li>
            Follow the rules of the platform you're using. For example, if you're
            using Discord, you must follow the Discord rules.<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Before you could talk with me even including being a friend, you must
            first tell what's your age. Lying about your age is not allowed, never will be allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are a zoophiles, then go away, I hate someone being that,
            they're weirdos.
        </li>
        <li>
            No talking about inappropriate topics, including your arts that can be
            nsfw unless I'm 18 years old.
        </li>
        <li>
            No roleplaying, I don't do that anymore.<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            If you want to show something, for example a document, a picture, a
            video, etc, you must first check that isn't nsfw.<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a><a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are a friend of myself, just a reminder I don't
            <b>defend anyone who where exposed</b>, unless if accused falsely.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lying is not allowed, you <b>must tell the truth</b> rather than
            hiding anything.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slight or mild trolling is okay, but if you're being rude or
            continuous trolling, you will be blocked anyways.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are exposed to a accusation or allegation which is verified
            properly, please, go away to me. Just don't talk at me.<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            If a person I normally follow gets harassed and you want to try to
            harsh me, <b>you can get permanently blocked without appeals</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            No don't attempt gaslight into me to do something bad as I know it can
            be abused easily
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't talk about politics, you've warned.

                    Does include that you
                    <b>must be 13 years old and above</b>. Being underaged will get you
                    locked unless you gave a id card or passport to verify it, only
                    applies to Discord.

                    Sometimes roleplaying with peoples can fall into something
                    inappropriate, like I've fallen victim four time this year because of it.

                    Expect it's a serious case, I know, I like reading it. But might
                    give up if it does too uncomfortable
                </p>

                    Like seriously, I don't wanna defend with anyone. I prefer being
                    neutral to anything.
