        <li>
          Before you could talk with me even including being a friend, you must
          first tell what's your age. Lying about your age is not allowed, never will be allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are a zoophiles, then go away, I hate someone being that,
          they're weirdos.
        </li>
        <li>
          No talking about inappropriate topics, including your arts that can be
          nsfw unless I'm 18 years old.
        </li>
        <li>
          No roleplaying, I don't do that anymore.<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to show something, for example a document, a picture, a
          video, etc, you must first check that isn't nsfw.<a href="#footnote-3"
            >[3]</a

        </li>
        <li>
          If you are a friend of myself, just a reminder I don't
          <b>defend anyone who where exposed</b>, unless if accused falsely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lying is not allowed, you <b>must tell the truth</b> rather than
          hiding anything.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slight or mild trolling is okay, but if you're being rude or
          continuous trolling, you will be blocked anyways.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are exposed to a accusation or allegation which is verified
          properly, please, go away to me. Just don't talk at me.<a

          If a person I normally follow gets harassed and you want to try to
          harsh me, <b>you can get permanently blocked without appeals</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          No don't attempt gaslight into me to do something bad as I know it can
          be abused easily
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't talk about politics, you've warned.

            Does include that you
            <b>must be 13 years old and above</b>. Being underaged will get you
            locked unless you gave a id card or passport to verify it, only

            Sometimes roleplaying with peoples can fall into something
            inappropriate, like I've fallen victim four time this year because of it.

            Expect it's a serious case, I know, I like reading it. But might

            Like seriously, I don't wanna defend with anyone. I prefer being
