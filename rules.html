            <p>
                You must comply this complete list of rules, so please read
                carefully before you could talk with me
            </p>
            <p>
                If you compromised one of these rule, you may get blocked
                permamently.
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    Follow the rules of the platform you're using. For example,
                    if you're using Discord, you must follow the Discord
                    rules.<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Before you could talk with me even including being a friend,
                    you must first tell what's your age. Lying about your age is
                    not allowed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are a zoophile, then go away, I hate someone being
                    that, they're weirdos.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No talking about inappropriate topics, including your arts
                    that might be nsfw.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No roleplaying, please don't do that.<a href="#footnote-2"
                        >[2]</a
                    >
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you want to show something, for example a document, a
                    picture, a video, etc, you must first check that isn't
                    nsfw.<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are a friend of myself, just a reminder I don't
                    <b>defend anyone who where exposed</b>, unless if accused
                    falsely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lying is not allowed, you <b>must tell the truth</b> rather
                    than hiding anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slight or mild trolling is okay, but if you're being rude or
                    continous trolling, you will be blocked anyways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are exposed to a accusation or allegation which is
                    verified properly, please, go away to me.<a

                        <b>must be 13 years old and above</b>. Being underaged
                        will get you locked unless you gave a id card or

                        Sometimes roleplaying with peoples can fall into
                        something inappropriate, like I've fallen victim because
                        of it.

                        But might give up if it does too uncomfortable

                        Like seriously, I don't wanna defend with anyone. I
                        prefer being neutral to anything.
